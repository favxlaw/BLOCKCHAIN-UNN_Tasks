# First Project From BUNN Web 3 Track
This is an ERC20 token with mint and burn functionality. The mint function allows the owner of the contract to mint (or create) new tokens, and the burn function allows the owner to burn (or remove from circulation) tokens. The total supply of tokens can be checked by calling the totalSupply function. The mint and burn functions are called in the constructor, which is called when the contract is created.

The mint function takes an amount as an argument and adds that amount to the totalSupply.
